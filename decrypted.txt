I THE PERIOD IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES IT WAS THE WORST OF TIMES IT WAS THE AGE OF WISDOM IT WAS THE AGE OF FOOLISHNESS IT WAS THE EPOCH OF BELIEF IT WAS THE EPOCH OF INCREDULITY IT WAS THE SEASON OF LIGHT IT WAS THE SEASON OF DARKNESS IT WAS THE SPRING OF HOPE IT WAS THE WINTER OF DESPAIR WE HAD EVERYTHING BEFORE US WE HAD NOTHING BEFORE US WE WERE ALL GOING DIRECT TO HEAVEN WE WERE ALL GOING DIRECT THE OTHER WAY IN SHORT THE PERIOD WAS SO FAR LIKE THE PRESENT PERIOD THAT SOME OF ITS NOISIEST AUTHORITIES INSISTED ON ITS BEING RECEIVED FOR GOOD OR FOR EVIL IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE OF COMPARISON ONLY THERE WERE A KING WITH A LARGE JAW AND A QUEEN WITH A PLAIN FACE ON THE THRONE OF ENGLAND THERE WERE A KING WITH A LARGE JAW AND A QUEEN WITH A FAIR FACE ON THE THRONE OF FRANCE IN BOTH COUNTRIES IT WAS CLEARER THAN CRYSTAL TO THE LORDS OF THE STATE PRESERVES OF LOAVES AND FISHES THAT THINGS IN GENERAL WERE SETTLED FOR EVER IT WAS THE YEAR OF OUR LORD ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE SPIRITUAL REVELATIONS WERE CONCEDED TO ENGLAND AT THAT FAVOURED PERIOD AS AT THIS MRS SOUTHCOTT HAD RECENTLY ATTAINED HER FIVEANDTWENTIETH BLESSED BIRTHDAY OF WHOM A PROPHETIC PRIVATE IN THE LIFE GUARDS HAD HERALDED THE SUBLIME APPEARANCE BY ANNOUNCING THAT ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR THE SWALLOWING UP OF LONDON AND WESTMINSTER EVEN THE COCKLANE GHOST HAD BEEN LAID ONLY A ROUND DOZEN OF YEARS AFTER RAPPING OUT ITS MESSAGES AS THE SPIRITS OF THIS VERY YEAR LAST PAST SUPERNATURALLY DEFICIENT IN ORIGINALITY RAPPED OUT THEIRS MERE MESSAGES IN THE EARTHLY ORDER OF EVENTS HAD LATELY COME TO THE ENGLISH CROWN AND PEOPLE FROM A CONGRESS OF BRITISH SUBJECTS IN AMERICA WHICH STRANGE TO RELATE HAVE PROVED MORE IMPORTANT TO THE HUMAN RACE THAN ANY COMMUNICATIONS YET RECEIVED THROUGH ANY OF THE CHICKENS OF THE COCKLANE BROOD FRANCE LESS FAVOURED ON THE WHOLE AS TO MATTERS SPIRITUAL THAN HER SISTER OF THE SHIELD AND TRIDENT ROLLED WITH EXCEEDING SMOOTHNESS DOWN HILL MAKING PAPER MONEY AND SPENDING IT UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF HER CHRISTIAN PASTORS SHE ENTERTAINED HERSELF BESIDES WITH SUCH HUMANE ACHIEVEMENTS AS SENTENCING A YOUTH TO HAVE HIS HANDS CUT OFF HIS TONGUE TORN OUT WITH PINCERS AND HIS BODY BURNED ALIVE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT KNEELED DOWN IN THE RAIN TO DO HONOUR TO A DIRTY PROCESSION OF MONKS WHICH PASSED WITHIN HIS VIEW AT A DISTANCE OF SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY YARDS IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT ROOTED IN THE WOODS OF FRANCE AND NORWAY THERE WERE GROWING TREES WHEN THAT SUFFERER WAS PUT TO DEATH ALREADY MARKED BY THE WOODMAN FATE TO COME DOWN AND BE SAWN INTO BOARDS TO MAKE A CERTAIN MOVABLE FRAMEWORK WITH A SACK AND A KNIFE IN IT TERRIBLE IN HISTORY IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT IN THE ROUGH OUTHOUSES OF SOME TILLERS OF THE HEAVY LANDS ADJACENT TO PARIS THERE WERE SHELTERED FROM THE WEATHER THAT VERY DAY RUDE CARTS BESPATTERED WITH RUSTIC MIRE SNUFFED ABOUT BY PIGS AND ROOSTED IN BY POULTRY WHICH THE FARMER DEATH HAD ALREADY SET APART TO BE HIS TUMBRILS OF THE REVOLUTION BUT THAT WOODMAN AND THAT FARMER THOUGH THEY WORK UNCEASINGLY WORK SILENTLY AND NO ONE HEARD THEM AS THEY WENT ABOUT WITH MUFFLED TREAD THE RATHER FORASMUCH AS TO ENTERTAIN ANY SUSPICION THAT THEY WERE AWAKE WAS TO BE ATHEISTICAL AND TRAITOROUS IN ENGLAND THERE WAS SCARCELY AN AMOUNT OF ORDER AND PROTECTION TO JUSTIFY MUCH NATIONAL BOASTING DARING BURGLARIES BY ARMED MEN AND HIGHWAY ROBBERIES TOOK PLACE IN THE CAPITAL ITSELF EVERY NIGHT FAMILIES WERE PUBLICLY CAUTIONED NOT TO GO OUT OF TOWN WITHOUT REMOVING THEIR FURNITURE TO UPHOLSTERERS WAREHOUSES FOR SECURITY THE HIGHWAYMAN IN THE DARK WAS A CITY TRADESMAN IN THE LIGHT AND BEING RECOGNISED AND CHALLENGED BY HIS FELLOWTRADESMAN WHOM HE STOPPED IN HIS CHARACTER OF THE CAPTAIN GALLANTLY SHOT HIM THROUGH THE HEAD AND RODE AWAY THE MAIL WAS WAYLAID BY SEVEN ROBBERS AND THE GUARD SHOT THREE DEAD AND THEN GOT SHOT DEAD HIMSELF BY THE OTHER FOUR IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE FAILURE OF HIS AMMUNITION AFTER WHICH THE MAIL WAS ROBBED IN PEACE THAT MAGNIFICENT POTENTATE THE LORD MAYOR OF LONDON WAS MADE TO STAND AND DELIVER ON TURNHAM GREEN BY ONE HIGHWAYMAN WHO DESPOILED THE ILLUSTRIOUS CREATURE IN SIGHT OF ALL HIS RETINUE PRISONERS IN LONDON GAOLS FOUGHT BATTLES WITH THEIR TURNKEYS AND THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW FIRED BLUNDERBUSSES IN AMONG THEM LOADED WITH ROUNDS OF SHOT AND BALL THIEVES SNIPPED OFF DIAMOND CROSSES FROM THE NECKS OF NOBLE LORDS AT COURT DRAWINGROOMS MUSKETEERS WENT INTO ST GILESS TO SEARCH FOR CONTRABAND GOODS AND THE MOB FIRED ON THE MUSKETEERS AND THE MUSKETEERS FIRED ON THE MOB AND NOBODY THOUGHT ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES MUCH OUT OF THE COMMON WAY IN THE MIDST OF THEM THE HANGMAN EVER BUSY AND EVER WORSE THAN USELESS WAS IN CONSTANT REQUISITION NOW STRINGING UP LONG ROWS OF MISCELLANEOUS CRIMINALS NOW HANGING A HOUSEBREAKER ON SATURDAY WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN ON TUESDAY NOW BURNING PEOPLE IN THE HAND AT NEWGATE BY THE DOZEN AND NOW BURNING PAMPHLETS AT THE DOOR OF WESTMINSTER HALL TODAY TAKING THE LIFE OF AN ATROCIOUS MURDERER AND TOMORROW OF A WRETCHED PILFERER WHO HAD ROBBED A FARMERS BOY OF SIXPENCE ALL THESE THINGS AND A THOUSAND LIKE THEM CAME TO PASS IN AND CLOSE UPON THE DEAR OLD YEAR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE ENVIRONED BY THEM WHILE THE WOODMAN AND THE FARMER WORKED UNHEEDED THOSE TWO OF THE LARGE JAWS AND THOSE OTHER TWO OF THE PLAIN AND THE FAIR FACES TROD WITH STIR ENOUGH AND CARRIED THEIR DIVINE RIGHTS WITH A HIGH HAND THUS DID THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE CONDUCT THEIR GREATNESSES AND MYRIADS OF SMALL CREATURESTHE CREATURES OF THIS CHRONICLE AMONG THE RESTALONG THE ROADS THAT LAY BEFORE THEM II THE MAIL IT WAS THE DOVER ROAD THAT LAY ON A FRIDAY NIGHT LATE IN NOVEMBER BEFORE THE FIRST OF THE PERSONS WITH WHOM THIS HISTORY HAS BUSINESS THE DOVER ROAD LAY AS TO HIM BEYOND THE DOVER MAIL AS IT LUMBERED UP SHOOTERS HILL HE WALKED UP HILL IN THE MIRE BY THE SIDE OF THE MAIL AS THE REST OF THE PASSENGERS DID NOT BECAUSE THEY HAD THE LEAST RELISH FOR WALKING EXERCISE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT BECAUSE THE HILL AND THE HARNESS AND THE MUD AND THE MAIL WERE ALL SO HEAVY THAT THE HORSES HAD THREE TIMES ALREADY COME TO A STOP BESIDES ONCE DRAWING THE COACH ACROSS THE ROAD WITH THE MUTINOUS INTENT OF TAKING IT BACK TO BLACKHEATH REINS AND WHIP AND COACHMAN AND GUARD HOWEVER IN COMBINATION HAD READ THAT ARTICLE OF WAR WHICH FORBADE A PURPOSE OTHERWISE STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF THE ARGUMENT THAT SOME BRUTE ANIMALS ARE ENDUED WITH REASON AND THE TEAM HAD CAPITULATED AND RETURNED TO THEIR DUTY WITH DROOPING HEADS AND TREMULOUS TAILS THEY MASHED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE THICK MUD FLOUNDERING AND STUMBLING BETWEEN WHILES AS IF THEY WERE FALLING TO PIECES AT THE LARGER JOINTS AS OFTEN AS THE DRIVER RESTED THEM AND BROUGHT THEM TO A STAND WITH A WARY WOHO SOHOTHEN THE NEAR LEADER VIOLENTLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND EVERYTHING UPON ITLIKE AN UNUSUALLY EMPHATIC HORSE DENYING THAT THE COACH COULD BE GOT UP THE HILL WHENEVER THE LEADER MADE THIS RATTLE THE PASSENGER STARTED AS A NERVOUS PASSENGER MIGHT AND WAS DISTURBED IN MIND THERE WAS A STEAMING MIST IN ALL THE HOLLOWS AND IT HAD ROAMED IN ITS FORLORNNESS UP THE HILL LIKE AN EVIL SPIRIT SEEKING REST AND FINDING NONE A CLAMMY AND INTENSELY COLD MIST IT MADE ITS SLOW WAY THROUGH THE AIR IN RIPPLES THAT VISIBLY FOLLOWED AND OVERSPREAD ONE ANOTHER AS THE WAVES OF AN UNWHOLESOME SEA MIGHT DO IT WAS DENSE ENOUGH TO SHUT OUT EVERYTHING FROM THE LIGHT OF THE COACHLAMPS BUT THESE ITS OWN WORKINGS AND A FEW YARDS OF ROAD AND THE REEK OF THE LABOURING HORSES STEAMED INTO IT AS IF THEY HAD MADE IT ALL TWO OTHER PASSENGERS BESIDES THE ONE WERE PLODDING UP THE HILL BY THE SIDE OF THE MAIL ALL THREE WERE WRAPPED TO THE CHEEKBONES AND OVER THE EARS AND WORE JACKBOOTS NOT ONE OF THE THREE COULD HAVE SAID FROM ANYTHING HE SAW WHAT EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO WAS LIKE AND EACH WAS HIDDEN UNDER ALMOST AS MANY WRAPPERS FROM THE EYES OF THE MIND AS FROM THE EYES OF THE BODY OF HIS TWO COMPANIONS IN THOSE DAYS TRAVELLERS WERE VERY SHY OF BEING CONFIDENTIAL ON A SHORT NOTICE FOR ANYBODY ON THE ROAD MIGHT BE A ROBBER OR IN LEAGUE WITH ROBBERS AS TO THE LATTER WHEN EVERY POSTINGHOUSE AND ALEHOUSE COULD PRODUCE SOMEBODY IN THE CAPTAINS PAY RANGING FROM THE LANDLORD TO THE LOWEST STABLE NONDESCRIPT IT WAS THE LIKELIEST THING UPON THE CARDS SO THE GUARD OF THE DOVER MAIL THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT FRIDAY NIGHT IN NOVEMBER ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE LUMBERING UP SHOOTERS HILL AS HE STOOD ON HIS OWN PARTICULAR PERCH BEHIND THE MAIL BEATING HIS FEET AND KEEPING AN EYE AND A HAND ON THE ARMCHEST BEFORE HIM WHERE A LOADED BLUNDERBUSS LAY AT THE TOP OF SIX OR EIGHT LOADED HORSEPISTOLS DEPOSITED ON A SUBSTRATUM OF CUTLASS THE DOVER MAIL WAS IN ITS USUAL GENIAL POSITION THAT THE GUARD SUSPECTED THE PASSENGERS THE PASSENGERS SUSPECTED ONE ANOTHER AND THE GUARD THEY ALL SUSPECTED EVERYBODY ELSE AND THE COACHMAN WAS SURE OF NOTHING BUT THE HORSES AS TO WHICH CATTLE HE COULD WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE HAVE TAKEN HIS OATH ON THE TWO TESTAMENTS THAT THEY WERE NOT FIT FOR THE JOURNEY WOHO SAID THE COACHMAN SO THEN ONE MORE PULL AND YOURE AT THE TOP AND BE DAMNED TO YOU FOR I HAVE HAD TROUBLE ENOUGH TO GET YOU TO ITJOE HALLOA THE GUARD REPLIED WHAT OCLOCK DO YOU MAKE IT JOE TEN MINUTES GOOD PAST ELEVEN MY BLOOD EJACULATED THE VEXED COACHMAN AND NOT ATOP OF SHOOTERS YET TST YAH GET ON WITH YOU THE EMPHATIC HORSE CUT SHORT BY THE WHIP IN A MOST DECIDED NEGATIVE MADE A DECIDED SCRAMBLE FOR IT AND THE THREE OTHER HORSES FOLLOWED SUIT ONCE MORE THE DOVER MAIL STRUGGLED ON WITH THE JACKBOOTS OF ITS PASSENGERS SQUASHING ALONG BY ITS SIDE THEY HAD STOPPED WHEN THE COACH STOPPED AND THEY KEPT CLOSE COMPANY WITH IT IF ANY ONE OF THE THREE HAD HAD THE HARDIHOOD TO PROPOSE TO ANOTHER TO WALK ON A LITTLE AHEAD INTO THE MIST AND DARKNESS HE WOULD HAVE PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY OF GETTING SHOT INSTANTLY AS A HIGHWAYMAN THE LAST BURST CARRIED THE MAIL TO THE SUMMIT OF THE HILL THE HORSES STOPPED TO BREATHE AGAIN AND THE GUARD GOT DOWN TO SKID THE WHEEL FOR THE DESCENT AND OPEN THE COACHDOOR TO LET THE PASSENGERS IN TST JOE CRIED THE COACHMAN IN A WARNING VOICE LOOKING DOWN FROM HIS BOX WHAT DO YOU SAY TOM THEY BOTH LISTENED I SAY A HORSE AT A CANTER COMING UP JOE I SAY A HORSE AT A GALLOP TOM RETURNED THE GUARD LEAVING HIS HOLD OF THE DOOR AND MOUNTING NIMBLY TO HIS PLACE GENTLEMEN IN THE KINGS NAME ALL OF YOU WITH THIS HURRIED ADJURATION HE COCKED HIS BLUNDERBUSS AND STOOD ON THE OFFENSIVE THE PASSENGER BOOKED BY THIS HISTORY WAS ON THE COACHSTEP GETTING IN THE TWO OTHER PASSENGERS WERE CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND ABOUT TO FOLLOW HE REMAINED ON THE STEP HALF IN THE COACH AND HALF OUT OF THEY REMAINED IN THE ROAD BELOW HIM THEY ALL LOOKED FROM THE COACHMAN TO THE GUARD AND FROM THE GUARD TO THE COACHMAN AND LISTENED THE COACHMAN LOOKED BACK AND THE GUARD LOOKED BACK AND EVEN THE EMPHATIC LEADER PRICKED UP HIS EARS AND LOOKED BACK WITHOUT CONTRADICTING THE STILLNESS CONSEQUENT ON THE CESSATION OF THE RUMBLING AND LABOURING OF THE COACH ADDED TO THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT MADE IT VERY QUIET INDEED THE PANTING OF THE HORSES COMMUNICATED A TREMULOUS MOTION TO THE COACH AS IF IT WERE IN A STATE OF AGITATION THE HEARTS OF THE PASSENGERS BEAT LOUD ENOUGH PERHAPS TO BE HEARD BUT AT ANY RATE THE QUIET PAUSE WAS AUDIBLY EXPRESSIVE OF PEOPLE OUT OF BREATH AND HOLDING THE BREATH AND HAVING THE PULSES QUICKENED BY EXPECTATION THE SOUND OF A HORSE AT A GALLOP CAME FAST AND FURIOUSLY UP THE HILL SOHO THE GUARD SANG OUT AS LOUD AS HE COULD ROAR YO THERE STAND I SHALL FIRE THE PACE WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED AND WITH MUCH SPLASHING AND FLOUNDERING A MANS VOICE CALLED FROM THE MIST IS THAT THE DOVER MAIL NEVER YOU MIND WHAT IT IS THE GUARD RETORTED WHAT ARE YOU IS THAT THE DOVER MAIL WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW I WANT A PASSENGER IF IT IS WHAT PASSENGER MR JARVIS LORRY OUR BOOKED PASSENGER SHOWED IN A MOMENT

LETS LOOK AT YOU THE FIGURES OF A HORSE AND RIDER CAME SLOWLY THROUGH THE EDDYING MIST AND CAME TO THE SIDE OF THE MAIL WHERE THE PASSENGER STOOD THE RIDER STOOPED AND CASTING UP HIS EYES AT THE GUARD HANDED THE PASSENGER A SMALL FOLDED PAPER THE RIDERS HORSE WAS BLOWN AND BOTH HORSE AND RIDER WERE COVERED WITH MUD FROM THE HOOFS OF THE HORSE TO THE HAT OF THE MAN GUARD SAID THE PASSENGER IN A TONE OF QUIET BUSINESS CONFIDENCE THE WATCHFUL GUARD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AT THE STOCK OF HIS RAISED BLUNDERBUSS HIS LEFT AT THE BARREL AND HIS EYE ON THE HORSEMAN ANSWERED CURTLY SIR THERE IS NOTHING TO APPREHEND I BELONG TO TELLSONS BANK YOU MUST KNOW TELLSONS BANK IN LONDON I AM GOING TO PARIS ON BUSINESS A CROWN TO DRINK I MAY READ THIS IF SO BE AS YOURE QUICK SIR HE OPENED IT IN THE LIGHT OF THE COACHLAMP ON THAT SIDE AND READFIRST TO HIMSELF AND THEN ALOUD WAIT AT DOVER FOR MAMSELLE ITS NOT LONG YOU SEE GUARD JERRY SAY THAT MY ANSWER WAS RECALLED TO LIFE JERRY STARTED IN HIS SADDLE THATS A BLAZING STRANGE ANSWER TOO SAID HE AT HIS HOARSEST TAKE THAT MESSAGE BACK AND THEY WILL KNOW THAT I RECEIVED THIS AS WELL AS IF I WROTE MAKE THE BEST OF YOUR WAY GOOD NIGHT WITH THOSE WORDS THE PASSENGER OPENED THE COACHDOOR AND GOT IN NOT AT ALL ASSISTED BY HIS FELLOWPASSENGERS WHO HAD EXPEDITIOUSLY SECRETED THEIR WATCHES AND PURSES IN THEIR BOOTS AND WERE NOW MAKING A GENERAL PRETENCE OF BEING ASLEEP WITH NO MORE DEFINITE PURPOSE THAN TO ESCAPE THE HAZARD OF ORIGINATING ANY OTHER KIND OF ACTION THE COACH LUMBERED ON AGAIN WITH HEAVIER WREATHS OF MIST CLOSING ROUND IT AS IT BEGAN THE DESCENT THE GUARD SOON REPLACED HIS BLUNDERBUSS IN HIS ARMCHEST AND HAVING LOOKED TO THE REST OF ITS CONTENTS AND HAVING LOOKED TO THE SUPPLEMENTARY PISTOLS THAT HE WORE IN HIS BELT LOOKED TO A SMALLER CHEST BENEATH HIS SEAT IN WHICH THERE WERE A FEW SMITHS TOOLS A COUPLE OF TORCHES AND A TINDERBOX FOR HE WAS FURNISHED WITH THAT COMPLETENESS THAT IF THE COACHLAMPS HAD BEEN BLOWN AND STORMED OUT WHICH DID OCCASIONALLY HAPPEN HE HAD ONLY TO SHUT HIMSELF UP INSIDE KEEP THE FLINT AND STEEL SPARKS WELL OFF THE STRAW AND GET A LIGHT WITH TOLERABLE SAFETY AND EASE IF HE WERE LUCKY IN FIVE MINUTES TOM SOFTLY OVER THE COACH ROOF HALLO JOE DID YOU HEAR THE MESSAGE I DID JOE WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT TOM NOTHING AT ALL JOE THATS A COINCIDENCE TOO THE GUARD MUSED FOR I MADE THE SAME OF IT MYSELF JERRY LEFT ALONE IN THE MIST AND DARKNESS DISMOUNTED MEANWHILE NOT ONLY TO EASE HIS SPENT HORSE BUT TO WIPE THE MUD FROM HIS FACE AND SHAKE THE WET OUT OF HIS HATBRIM WHICH MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF HOLDING ABOUT HALF A GALLON AFTER STANDING WITH THE BRIDLE OVER HIS HEAVILYSPLASHED ARM UNTIL THE WHEELS OF THE MAIL WERE NO LONGER WITHIN HEARING AND THE NIGHT WAS QUITE STILL AGAIN HE TURNED TO WALK DOWN THE HILL AFTER THAT THERE GALLOP FROM TEMPLE BAR OLD LADY I WONT TRUST YOUR FORELEGS TILL I GET YOU ON THE LEVEL SAID THIS HOARSE MESSENGER GLANCING AT HIS MARE RECALLED TO LIFE THATS A BLAZING STRANGE MESSAGE MUCH OF THAT WOULDNT DO FOR YOU JERRY I SAY JERRY YOUD BE IN A BLAZING BAD WAY IF RECALLING TO LIFE WAS TO COME INTO FASHION JERRY III THE NIGHT SHADOWS A WONDERFUL FACT TO REFLECT UPON THAT EVERY HUMAN CREATURE IS CONSTITUTED TO BE THAT PROFOUND SECRET AND MYSTERY TO EVERY OTHER A SOLEMN CONSIDERATION WHEN I ENTER A GREAT CITY BY NIGHT THAT EVERY ONE OF THOSE DARKLY CLUSTERED HOUSES ENCLOSES ITS OWN SECRET THAT EVERY ROOM IN EVERY ONE OF THEM ENCLOSES ITS OWN SECRET THAT EVERY BEATING HEART IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BREASTS THERE IS IN SOME OF ITS IMAGININGS A SECRET TO THE HEART NEAREST IT SOMETHING OF THE AWFULNESS EVEN OF DEATH ITSELF IS REFERABLE TO THIS NO MORE CAN I TURN THE LEAVES OF THIS DEAR BOOK THAT I LOVED AND VAINLY HOPE IN TIME TO READ IT ALL NO MORE CAN I LOOK INTO THE DEPTHS OF THIS UNFATHOMABLE WATER WHEREIN AS MOMENTARY LIGHTS GLANCED INTO IT I HAVE HAD GLIMPSES OF BURIED TREASURE AND OTHER THINGS SUBMERGED IT WAS APPOINTED THAT THE BOOK SHOULD SHUT WITH A SPRING FOR EVER AND FOR EVER WHEN I HAD READ BUT A PAGE IT WAS APPOINTED THAT THE WATER SHOULD BE LOCKED IN AN ETERNAL FROST WHEN THE LIGHT WAS PLAYING ON ITS SURFACE AND I STOOD IN IGNORANCE ON THE SHORE MY FRIEND IS DEAD MY NEIGHBOUR IS DEAD MY LOVE THE DARLING OF MY SOUL IS DEAD IT IS THE INEXORABLE CONSOLIDATION AND PERPETUATION OF THE SECRET THAT WAS ALWAYS IN THAT INDIVIDUALITY AND WHICH I SHALL CARRY IN MINE TO MY LIFES END IN ANY OF THE BURIALPLACES OF THIS CITY THROUGH WHICH I PASS IS THERE A SLEEPER MORE INSCRUTABLE THAN ITS BUSY INHABITANTS ARE IN THEIR INNERMOST PERSONALITY TO ME OR THAN I AM TO THEM AS TO THIS HIS NATURAL AND NOT TO BE ALIENATED INHERITANCE THE MESSENGER ON HORSEBACK HAD EXACTLY THE SAME POSSESSIONS AS THE KING THE FIRST MINISTER OF STATE OR THE RICHEST MERCHANT IN LONDON SO WITH THE THREE PASSENGERS SHUT UP IN THE NARROW COMPASS OF ONE LUMBERING OLD MAIL COACH THEY WERE MYSTERIES TO ONE ANOTHER AS COMPLETE AS IF EACH HAD BEEN IN HIS OWN COACH AND SIX OR HIS OWN COACH AND SIXTY WITH THE BREADTH OF A COUNTY BETWEEN HIM AND THE NEXT THE MESSENGER RODE BACK AT AN EASY TROT STOPPING PRETTY OFTEN AT ALEHOUSES BY THE WAY TO DRINK BUT EVINCING A TENDENCY TO KEEP HIS OWN COUNSEL AND TO KEEP HIS HAT COCKED OVER HIS EYES HE HAD EYES THAT ASSORTED VERY WELL WITH THAT DECORATION BEING OF A SURFACE BLACK WITH NO DEPTH IN THE COLOUR OR FORM AND MUCH TOO NEAR TOGETHERAS IF THEY WERE AFRAID OF BEING FOUND OUT IN SOMETHING SINGLY IF THEY KEPT TOO FAR APART THEY HAD A SINISTER EXPRESSION UNDER AN OLD COCKEDHAT LIKE A THREECORNERED SPITTOON AND OVER A GREAT MUFFLER FOR THE CHIN AND THROAT WHICH DESCENDED NEARLY TO THE WEARERS KNEES WHEN HE STOPPED FOR DRINK HE MOVED THIS MUFFLER WITH HIS LEFT HAND ONLY WHILE HE POURED HIS LIQUOR IN WITH HIS RIGHT AS SOON AS THAT WAS DONE HE MUFFLED AGAIN NO JERRY NO SAID THE MESSENGER HARPING ON ONE THEME AS HE RODE IT WOULDNT DO FOR YOU JERRY JERRY YOU HONEST TRADESMAN IT WOULDNT SUIT YOUR LINE OF BUSINESS RECALLED BUST ME IF I DONT THINK HED BEEN A DRINKING HIS MESSAGE PERPLEXED HIS MIND TO THAT DEGREE THAT HE WAS FAIN SEVERAL TIMES TO TAKE OFF HIS HAT TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD EXCEPT ON THE CROWN WHICH WAS RAGGEDLY BALD HE HAD STIFF BLACK HAIR STANDING JAGGEDLY ALL OVER IT AND GROWING DOWN HILL ALMOST TO HIS BROAD BLUNT NOSE IT WAS SO LIKE SMITHS WORK SO MUCH MORE LIKE THE TOP OF A STRONGLY SPIKED WALL THAN A HEAD OF HAIR THAT THE BEST OF PLAYERS AT LEAPFROG MIGHT HAVE DECLINED HIM AS THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN THE WORLD TO GO OVER WHILE HE TROTTED BACK WITH THE MESSAGE HE WAS TO DELIVER TO THE NIGHT WATCHMAN IN HIS BOX AT THE DOOR OF TELLSONS BANK BY TEMPLE BAR WHO WAS TO DELIVER IT TO GREATER AUTHORITIES WITHIN THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT TOOK SUCH SHAPES TO HIM AS AROSE OUT OF THE MESSAGE AND TOOK SUCH SHAPES TO THE MARE AS AROSE OUT OF HER PRIVATE TOPICS OF UNEASINESS THEY SEEMED TO BE NUMEROUS FOR SHE SHIED AT EVERY SHADOW ON THE ROAD WHAT TIME THE MAILCOACH LUMBERED JOLTED RATTLED AND BUMPED UPON ITS TEDIOUS WAY WITH ITS THREE FELLOWINSCRUTABLES INSIDE TO WHOM LIKEWISE THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT REVEALED THEMSELVES IN THE FORMS THEIR DOZING EYES AND WANDERING THOUGHTS SUGGESTED TELLSONS BANK HAD A RUN UPON IT IN THE MAIL AS THE BANK PASSENGERWITH AN ARM DRAWN THROUGH THE LEATHERN STRAP WHICH DID WHAT LAY IN IT TO KEEP HIM FROM POUNDING AGAINST THE NEXT PASSENGER AND DRIVING HIM INTO HIS CORNER WHENEVER THE COACH GOT A SPECIAL JOLTNODDED IN HIS PLACE WITH HALFSHUT EYES THE LITTLE COACHWINDOWS AND THE COACHLAMP DIMLY GLEAMING THROUGH THEM AND THE BULKY BUNDLE OF OPPOSITE PASSENGER BECAME THE BANK AND DID A GREAT STROKE OF BUSINESS THE RATTLE OF THE HARNESS WAS THE CHINK OF MONEY AND MORE DRAFTS WERE HONOURED IN FIVE MINUTES THAN EVEN TELLSONS WITH ALL ITS FOREIGN AND HOME CONNECTION EVER PAID IN THRICE THE TIME THEN THE STRONGROOMS UNDERGROUND AT TELLSONS WITH SUCH OF THEIR VALUABLE STORES AND SECRETS AS WERE KNOWN TO THE PASSENGER AND IT WAS NOT A LITTLE THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THEM OPENED BEFORE HIM AND HE WENT IN AMONG THEM WITH THE GREAT KEYS AND THE FEEBLYBURNING CANDLE AND FOUND THEM SAFE AND STRONG AND SOUND AND STILL JUST AS HE HAD LAST SEEN THEM BUT THOUGH THE BANK WAS ALMOST ALWAYS WITH HIM AND THOUGH THE COACH IN A CONFUSED WAY LIKE THE PRESENCE OF PAIN UNDER AN OPIATE WAS ALWAYS WITH HIM THERE WAS ANOTHER CURRENT OF IMPRESSION THAT NEVER CEASED TO RUN ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO DIG SOME ONE OUT OF A GRAVE NOW WHICH OF THE MULTITUDE OF FACES THAT SHOWED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM WAS THE TRUE FACE OF THE BURIED PERSON THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT DID NOT INDICATE BUT THEY WERE ALL THE FACES OF A MAN OF FIVEANDFORTY BY YEARS AND THEY DIFFERED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PASSIONS THEY EXPRESSED AND IN THE GHASTLINESS OF THEIR WORN AND WASTED STATE PRIDE CONTEMPT DEFIANCE STUBBORNNESS SUBMISSION LAMENTATION SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER SO DID VARIETIES OF SUNKEN CHEEK CADAVEROUS COLOUR EMACIATED HANDS AND FIGURES BUT THE FACE WAS IN THE MAIN ONE FACE AND EVERY HEAD WAS PREMATURELY WHITE A HUNDRED TIMES THE DOZING PASSENGER INQUIRED OF THIS SPECTRE BURIED HOW LONG THE ANSWER WAS ALWAYS THE SAME ALMOST EIGHTEEN YEARS YOU HAD ABANDONED ALL HOPE OF BEING DUG OUT LONG AGO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE RECALLED TO LIFE THEY TELL ME SO I HOPE YOU CARE TO LIVE I CANT SAY SHALL I SHOW HER TO YOU WILL YOU COME AND SEE HER THE ANSWERS TO THIS QUESTION WERE VARIOUS AND CONTRADICTORY SOMETIMES THE BROKEN REPLY WAS WAIT IT WOULD KILL ME IF I SAW HER TOO SOON SOMETIMES IT WAS GIVEN IN A TENDER RAIN OF TEARS AND THEN IT WAS TAKE ME TO HER SOMETIMES IT WAS STARING AND BEWILDERED AND THEN IT WAS I DONT KNOW HER I DONT UNDERSTAND AFTER SUCH IMAGINARY DISCOURSE THE PASSENGER IN HIS FANCY WOULD DIG AND DIG DIGNOW WITH A SPADE NOW WITH A GREAT KEY NOW WITH HIS HANDSTO DIG THIS WRETCHED CREATURE OUT GOT OUT AT LAST WITH EARTH HANGING ABOUT HIS FACE AND HAIR HE WOULD SUDDENLY FAN AWAY TO DUST THE PASSENGER WOULD THEN START TO HIMSELF AND LOWER THE WINDOW TO GET THE REALITY OF MIST AND RAIN ON HIS CHEEK YET EVEN WHEN HIS EYES WERE OPENED ON THE MIST AND RAIN ON THE MOVING PATCH OF LIGHT FROM THE LAMPS AND THE HEDGE AT THE ROADSIDE RETREATING BY JERKS THE NIGHT SHADOWS OUTSIDE THE COACH WOULD FALL INTO THE TRAIN OF THE NIGHT SHADOWS WITHIN THE REAL BANKINGHOUSE BY TEMPLE BAR THE REAL BUSINESS OF THE PAST DAY THE REAL STRONG ROOMS THE REAL EXPRESS SENT AFTER HIM AND THE REAL MESSAGE RETURNED WOULD ALL BE THERE OUT OF THE MIDST OF THEM THE GHOSTLY FACE WOULD RISE AND HE WOULD ACCOST IT AGAIN BURIED HOW LONG ALMOST EIGHTEEN YEARS I HOPE YOU CARE TO LIVE I CANT SAY DIGDIGDIGUNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT FROM ONE OF THE TWO PASSENGERS WOULD ADMONISH HIM TO PULL UP THE WINDOW DRAW HIS ARM SECURELY THROUGH THE LEATHERN STRAP AND SPECULATE UPON THE TWO SLUMBERING FORMS UNTIL HIS MIND LOST ITS HOLD OF THEM AND THEY AGAIN SLID AWAY INTO THE BANK AND THE GRAVE BURIED HOW LONG ALMOST EIGHTEEN YEARS YOU HAD ABANDONED ALL HOPE OF BEING DUG OUT LONG AGO THE WORDS WERE STILL IN HIS HEARING AS JUST SPOKENDISTINCTLY IN HIS HEARING AS EVER SPOKEN WORDS HAD BEEN IN HIS LIFEWHEN THE WEARY PASSENGER STARTED TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAYLIGHT AND FOUND THAT THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT WERE GONE HE LOWERED THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT AT THE RISING SUN THERE WAS A RIDGE OF PLOUGHED LAND WITH A PLOUGH UPON IT WHERE IT HAD BEEN LEFT LAST NIGHT WHEN THE HORSES WERE UNYOKED BEYOND A QUIET COPPICEWOOD IN WHICH MANY LEAVES OF BURNING RED AND GOLDEN YELLOW STILL REMAINED UPON THE TREES THOUGH THE EARTH WAS COLD AND WET THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THE SUN ROSE BRIGHT PLACID AND BEAUTIFUL EIGHTEEN YEARS SAID THE PASSENGER LOOKING AT THE SUN GRACIOUS CREATOR OF DAY TO BE BURIED ALIVE FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS
